# Distributed Systems

Curated list of concepts, patterns, articles and more to get an understanding of Distributed System.
Trying to build an understanding on how large scale distributed systems are build.

### Before Starting

One should be well versed with basic concepts of Operating Systems like

* Memory Management , Virtual Memory, Paging
* File Systems Works
* Networking basics like TCP/IP & UDP, CIDR 
* Concurrency

### Introducing Distributed System

A nice article to start the journey of understanding distributed system.

### Fallacies of distributed systems

 One should be clear about some of the wrong assumptions we programmer/developers make about distributed systems
 
* The network is reliable;
* Latency is zero;
* Bandwidth is infinite;
* The network is secure;
* Topology doesn't change;
* There is one administrator;
* Transport cost is zero;
* The network is homogeneous.

Some good explanation with examples follows here -> https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~zuyu/files/fallacies.pdf
