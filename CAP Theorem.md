## CAP Theorem


### How is Cap Interpreted

**Consistency**: A certain read must contain the most recently written data.
**Availability**: The system must respond with data (if available)
**Partition Tolerance**: The system can function with partitions, i.e. the data is stored across multiple nodes.

CAP theroem states that one can only choose only 2 out of the above 3 in a data store.
