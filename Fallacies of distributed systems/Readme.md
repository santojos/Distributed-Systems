### Fallacies of distributed systems

One should be clear about some of the wrong assumptions we programmer/developers make about distributed systems

* The network is reliable;
* Latency is zero;
* Bandwidth is infinite;
* The network is secure;
* Topology doesn't change;
* There is one administrator;
* Transport cost is zero;
* The network is homogeneous.
